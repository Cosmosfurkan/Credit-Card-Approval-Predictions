Introduction
Credit card approval prediction is a crucial task in the financial industry. This project explores different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors to predict credit card approval based on historical data.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found here. It contains various features such as income, age, and employment status, which are used to predict the credit card approval status.

Preprocessing
The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features. These steps ensure that the data is suitable for training machine learning models.

Model Training
The project employs several machine learning algorithms for credit card approval prediction. The models include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Each model is trained on a preprocessed dataset to make predictions.

Evaluation
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy. The evaluation results provide insights into the effectiveness of different algorithms in predicting credit card approval.

Confusion Matrix Visualization
Confusion matrices are visualized for Decision Trees and Logistic Regression models. These visualizations offer a comprehensive view of the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
